      <description>The main goal of the Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC) is to provide a common testbed to evaluate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) of dialog systems and related technologies, including natural language processing, audio and speech processing, and vision information processing.
The tenth challenge of DSTC is held at AAAI-22 on February 28th - March 1st, 2022. Botomatic Inc. is the only team that submits a single model due to GPU resource constraint.</description>
